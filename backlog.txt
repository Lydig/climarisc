Interactive map

Grey areas instead of outlines for the map / Less weight on the outlines

Country hover tooltip

Map zoom, country zoom

Interative map of all the yields, periods, crop coverage, time, change

Summary statistics like highest yield country per crop etc.

Crops compared to each other - which are more popular, more yielding, change comapred to each other, are some becoming more/less yielding/grown, more or less affected


1. get more data (stressors etc.)
    management might be difficult
    soil grid database - soil gis data
    climate - important
    nasa power - api - free time series - not super great client - used for predicting solar energy potential
    solar irradiation
    crop simulation model for python - pretty nice interface - pulls in from nasa power - good palce to start
    evapotranspiratin - important - Penman-Monteith equation
    precipitation - important
    porosity soil
    organic content of soil
    soil moisture = precipitation - evapotranspiration
    wilting point - soil moisture at which the plant cant extract
    field capacity - sponge capacity
    surface net solar radiation
    if we match the ERA up with our dataset we have the climatic components

2. interactive visualization
    bokeh
    shiny
    streamlit.io
    d3
    tablo

3. vulnerability curves

4. scatterplot matrix
    plot all the variables vs all the variables
