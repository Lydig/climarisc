    "\n",
    "*   **Data Structure & Quality:** The dataset is a 3D cube (lat, lon, time) covering 1981-2016. It loaded correctly, and the spatial and temporal dimensions are as expected.\n",
    "*   **Global Trend:** The global average yield shows a strong upward trend, doubling from ~2.5 to ~5.0 t/ha. This \"technology trend\" is the dominant signal in the raw data. The year-to-year fluctuations around this trend are what we will investigate as potential climate signals.\n",
    "*   **Regional Differences:** The comparison between the US and Nigeria highlights the critical need for stratification.\n",
    "    *   The **US** shows high absolute yields and a steep growth trend but also exhibits extreme year-to-year variability, suggesting high sensitivity to shocks.\n",
    "    *   **Nigeria** shows low absolute yields and a much flatter growth trend, representing a completely different agricultural system.\n",
    "*   **Conclusion:** The EDA confirms the dataset is suitable for our project. The clear regional differences validate our plan to stratify the analysis rather than relying on global averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps: Moving to the Main Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA is now complete. Our next phase of work will be to link this yield data to climate data to build our first vulnerability curves. This will likely involve:\n",
    "1.  **Sourcing Climate Data:** Finding and downloading a gridded climate dataset (e.g., temperature and precipitation) that matches our data's spatial and temporal resolution.\n",
    "2.  **Calculating Yield Anomalies:** We will need to \"de-trend\" the yield data to remove the long-term technology signal and isolate the year-to-year variability.\n",
    "3.  **Creating our first scatter plot:** Plotting yield anomalies against a climate variable (like growing-season temperature) to look for the dose-response relationship that will become our first vulnerability curve."
