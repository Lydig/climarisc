    "## Updated GLM models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on adressing comments we recieved on our gamma models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main strokes of the comments were the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "When we used C(cell_id) in our previous attempt, we are creating a seperate parameter for every single grid cell. This is a fixed effect approach, which works, but it is using a lot of the models power to describe baseline differences. So instead of treating each cell as a unique, independant category, we want to try modeling the spatial variation as a smooth surface using bsplines for the lat and lon columns. This is essentially us saying that yields don't just randomly vary from cell to cell; they vary smoothly across latitude and longitude. A cell in the Po Valley will have a similar baseline yield to its immediate neighbor, and this effect will gradually change as you move towards the mountains. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should focus on using splines for things we want to control for, and not our explanitory variables. Our inital model, we added a bspline to our tempature variable. This adds a lot of flexability and makes the coefciients hard to interpret. So in this attempt, we would use splines on things like lat and long, while for temperature_Jul (and other stressors), go back to using parametric functions that have a clear mathematical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our earlier attmept added stressors one by one using a form of forward selection. However, we got the suggestion that we should start by having all the stressors, and drop one out at a time. This approach is a form of \"backward elimination\" grouped by stressor type. We will start with a \"full\" model containing all plausible monthly stressors. Then, we will systematically remove one entire group of stressors at a time (e.g., all 5 monthly temperature variables) and see how much the model's performance (AIC) suffers. The group whose removal hurts the model the most is the most important group of predictors."

    "\n",
    "This is a significant but very positive pivot. Here is the new, improved workflow based on our advisor's guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: The New \"Full\" Model Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   First, we need to define our comprehensive starting model.\n",
    "*   **Formula:** `yield_maize ~ year + [ALL_MONTHLY_STRESSORS] + bs(lat, df=4) + bs(lon, df=4)`\n",
    "    *   `[ALL_MONTHLY_STRESSORS]` will include all monthly temperature, precipitation, and soil water variables for the maize growing season (e.g., `temperature_May`, `temperature_Jun`... `precipitation_May`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We will fit the \"Full\" model from Step 1 and record its AIC as our baseline.\n",
    "*   Then, we will create a loop:\n",
    "    1.  **Remove Temperature Group:** Fit the model again without *any* of the `temperature_*` variables. Record the new, higher AIC.\n",
    "    2.  **Remove Precipitation Group:** Go back to the full model, but this time remove all `precipitation_*` variables. Record the AIC.\n",
    "    3.  **Remove Soil Water Group:** Repeat for `soil_water_*`.\n",
    "*   **Outcome:** We will have a clear ranking. The stressor group that causes the biggest *increase* in AIC when removed is the most important one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Build and Refine the Final Explanatory Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Using the most important stressor group(s) identified in Step 2, we will build our final, parsimonious model.\n",
    "*   This is where we follow the advisor's other key pieces of advice:\n",
    "    *   **Test Parametric Non-Linearity:** For the most important single variable (e.g., `temperature_Jul`), we will test different functional forms like quadratic `(temp + I(temp**2))`, logarithmic `(log(temp))`, etc., and use AIC to choose the best one.\n",
    "    *   **Test Interactions:** We will explicitly test the `temperature_Jul * temperature_May` interaction, as it was a strong signal in our previous work.\n",
    "    *   **The new model idea your advisor gave is a perfect starting point for this step:** `yield_maize ~ year + temperature_Jul * temperature_May + bs(lat, df=4) + bs(lon, df=4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Extend to Other Crops & Synthesize**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Once we have this new, highly robust workflow finalized for maize, we will then apply the *exact same process* (Steps 1-3) to the other four crops.\n",
    "*   This will give you an even stronger and more directly comparable set of final results for your presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent research plan. It's more rigorous, addresses potential issues with our previous approach, and will lead to conclusions you can be extremely confident in.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this new plan sound to you? If you're on board, we can start by writing the code for **Step 1 and 2: Defining the full model and implementing the LOGO feature selection loop.**"

    "    *   **The Culprit:** These variables are all different ways of measuring the same underlying phenomenon: **heat**. Potential evaporation is a direct physical consequence of temperature and solar energy. The high VIF scores confirm they are so tightly interlinked that the model cannot distinguish their individual effects. It's statistically impossible to interpret the coefficient for `temperature_Aug` when `potential_evaporation_Aug` is also in the model.\n",

    "### Justification for Our New Modeling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this VIF analysis and the LOGO results, we can now justify our final modeling plan with very strong evidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Justification:**\n",
    "The initial LOGO analysis showed that the `Temperature` group was the most important predictor, while the `Solar` group was redundant. A subsequent VIF analysis on the full model confirmed severe multicollinearity among the heat-related variables. Specifically, all `potential_evaporation` variables and most `temperature` and `solar_radiation` variables showed VIF scores far exceeding the problematic threshold of 10. This indicates that these variables carry overlapping information, making their individual coefficients unstable and uninterpretable. In contrast, the `precipitation` variables showed low VIF scores, indicating they provide unique explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to build a parsimonious and robust explanatory model, we will proceed by:\n",
    "1.  **Selecting one primary heat variable** (e.g., `temperature_Jul`, based on our previous findings) to represent the dominant effect of temperature stress.\n",
    "2.  **Excluding** the other highly collinear heat-related groups (`potential_evaporation`, `solar_radiation`, and other monthly temperatures) as separate, independent main effects to ensure model stability.\n",
    "3.  **Including precipitation** as a key secondary stressor and testing its interaction with temperature to model the critical heat-drought effect."

    "*   **`precipitation_Jul`:** `coef=0.0034`, `p=0.000`. The main effect of rain is now **positive and highly significant**. This is great! In this more correctly specified model, we see that, on average, more rain in July is good for yield.\n",
    "*   **`I(precipitation_Jul ** 2)`:** `coef=-3.823e-06`, `p=0.000`. This is the quadratic term for precipitation. It's significant and negative. This tells us the relationship with rain is non-linear: the benefit of rain is positive, but there are diminishing returns. Too much rain eventually leads to a slight decrease in the benefit (a classic \"hump shape\").\n",
    "*   **`temperature_Jul:precipitation_Jul`:** `coef=-0.0001`, `p=0.000`. This is the heat x drought interaction. It's **negative and highly significant.** This is the buffering effect! The negative coefficient means that as precipitation increases, it counteracts the positive coefficient on `temperature_Jul`, making the overall effect of heat less damaging.\n",

    "### A New, More Complete Story\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now tell an even richer story than before:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A warm start to the season (`temperature_May`) is beneficial for setting a high yield potential.\n",
    "2.  However, this creates a \"live fast, die young\" scenario, as the negative interaction term shows these high-potential crops are then *more sensitive* to the heat that comes in July.\n",
    "3.  The damage from July heat is itself a complex function, moderated by rainfall. The negative interaction between `temperature_Jul` and `precipitation_Jul` proves that adequate rainfall acts as a buffer, mitigating the damage from high temperatures.\n",
    "4.  The relationship with rainfall itself is non-linear, with diminishing returns at very high levels.\n"

    "Our data-driven vulnerability curve shows the percentage of maize yield lost due to increasing heat stress in July, relative to a cool, non-stressful baseline. The curve begins at 0% loss at low temperatures, not because these are optimal for growth, but because they represent a condition of zero heat stress. As the average July temperature rises, the damage from heat begins and accelerates, leading to a predicted yield loss of over 60% as temperatures approach 26°C"
