Project work in collaboration with a public or private company or an organisation. The project process may include the solution of a concrete, professional/academic problem and/or the performance of professionally/academically relevant tasks in collaboration with the employees of the company/organisation.

  
The company project will allow the student to independently apply and develop professional/academic and personal skills, e.g. in self-management and self-learning, communication and presentation, collaboration, problem-solving and innovation, as well as IT and research skills.

  
In collaboration with BiRC and the company, a contract must be drawn up for the project period, containing a project description and a schedule for the activity and time. The contract must be approved by the chair of the Education Committee before the start of the semester.  
  

It is up to the student to find a company for the project and a competent project supervisor (from the company) and  the internal supervisor (associated to BiRC). This must be done before the start of the semester. The student must not carry out a company project with a company where he/she is working during her/his spare time.

## Description of qualifications

**Objectives of the course  
**The aim of the company project is to allow the student to apply and develop his/her professional skills in a company or an organisation, in order to:

-   Develop and strengthen the student's competencies based on a company collaboration

-   Strengthen the insight into the academic and professional qualifications needed as a bioinformatician in a given job situation;
-   Strengthen the insight into significant personal competences in the working life after the study.

**Learning outcomes and competences  
**

-   Describe the company or organisation in which the project was carried out (i.e. the company's product/services, organisational structure, job types and tasks). If the company or organisation is very large, this is limited to the operational unit where the project was carried out.

-   Explain the project carried out, including its purpose, the methods, the specific tasks and processes
-   Describe and discuss a professional/an academic issue that motivates the work done in relation to the company

-   Summarise and discuss the results produced
-   Reflect on the significance of the results to the company or organisation and the professional/academic field

-   Describe the professional/academic qualifications and personal competences that were used or acquired during the course
-   Identify what skills and qualifications are needed to strengthen before the transition from student life to working life.

### Comments on the form of instruction

The vocational training project is carried out independently under the guidance/supervision of a project supervisor from a company or an organisation and an academic supervisor from the department. Registered students must contact the project coordinator at BiRC, in order to find an internal academic supervisor. The project coordinator arranges a dialogue meeting between the student and the supervisor. The student must contact the project coordinator before contacting a company.
