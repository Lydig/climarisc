    "\n",
    "First thing that sticks out to me is the Pseudo R-squared value. It is very high. The combo of year and individual cell_id fixed effects are explaining almost all the variance in the absolute yield values. This however makes sense, as a cell in a really ideal area should always have a higher average yield compared to a cell in a less fertile area. So our fixed effects are correctly capturing baseline dofferences, which means we can be more confident that the climate coeffeicants are truly explainig the deviations from the average in each cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the coefficients, we need to remember that we used a log link, so they reprsent a multiplicative or precentage change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept and c(cell_id) are our fixed effects. \n",
    "- The cell_id individual coeficcients are not really that intresting. These are simply herer to control for the baseline differences in location. \n",
    "- The year coeficcient: coef = 0.0107, P>|z| = 0.000 is our technology/management trend. It's positive and highly significant. It means that, holding all else constant, maize yields increased by about 1.07% per year on average across this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "bs(temperature_Jul, df=4)[0] through [3]: These are the coefficients for our spline. Crucially, we do not interpret these numbers individually. They are the weights for the basis functions that, together, create the flexible curve for the effect of July temperature. The key takeaway here is that their p-values are all extremely low (0.000). This tells us that the curve they collectively define is a highly statistically significant predictor of yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "soil_water_Jul: coef = 0.1651, P>|z| = 0.052. This is the effect of soil water in July. It's positive, as we'd expect (more water is generally good). The p-value of 0.052 is \"marginally significant.\" It's right on the edge of the standard 0.05 cutoff. In Model 2, it was highly significant, but its importance has been slightly reduced by the addition of the temperature spline, suggesting some overlap in the information they provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparing the 4 models !!\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the new models are an improvement from the original single stressor models, which was expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model 1 -> Model 2: Adding soil_water_Jul lowers the AIC (from 3999.78 to 3998.33). The improvement is small but real. It tells us that knowing the soil moisture adds a little bit of explanatory power on top of knowing the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model 2 -> Model 4: Allowing temperature_Jul to be a flexible curve (spline) instead of a straight line lowers the AIC again (from 3998.33 to 3997.27). This confirms your non-linear hypothesis! The curve is a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Big Finding (Model 2 -> Model 3): Your observation is spot on. Adding temperature_May to the model with linear July temperature and soil water causes a huge drop in AIC (from 3998.33 down to 3947.66). This is a much larger improvement than we got from adding the spline. It's a very strong signal that conditions at the start of the growing season have a major impact on the final yield, even after accounting for the critical stress period in July.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that a warmer May can lead to a better early season growth and root development for Maize, making it more resiliant to the heat and water stress it can face in July. And then the oposite is also true, a bad start in Mayb can make the plant more vulnerable to any stress that comes later. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. We've Quantified the Long-Term Trend: \"After controlling for location-specific advantages, we found that maize yields in Northern Italy have been increasing by approximately 1.1% per year from 1982-2016. This is likely due to a combination of technological and management improvements.\" (This comes from the year coefficient).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We've Confirmed a Critical Vulnerability Period: \"Our analysis confirms that the single month of July is a critical period for maize yield. Climate stressors during this month have a disproportionately large impact compared to the growing season as a whole.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We've Modeled a Non-Linear \"Damage Curve\": \"The relationship between July heat and maize yield is not a straight line. Our model shows that the damage accelerates at higher temperatures. The difference between a 24°C and 25°C July is significantly more harmful than the difference between an 18°C and 19°C July.\" (This is the contribution of the spline).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Main Finding - We've Discovered a Resilience Factor: \"Most importantly, we discovered that the vulnerability of maize to July heat is not fixed. It is significantly moderated by conditions earlier in the season. A warmer May leads to higher overall yield potential, making the crop more robust and resilient against subsequent heat stress in July.\" (This is the story told by your interaction plot)."

Doesn't more rain lead to more yield? What this tells us is that, on average, the effect of rain is not consistent. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. This is because its importance depends on another factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Interaction Effect (bs(temperature_Jul...):precipitation_Jul)\n",

    "        - bs(...)[3]:precipitation_Jul: p=0.005 (highly significant!)\n",
    "    - Interpretation: The fact that these interaction terms are significant (especially the one for the highest temperature part of the spline) tells us that the effect of July precipitation DEPENDS on the July temperature.\n",
    "    - What is the direction? The coefficient for the significant interaction ([3]) is positive (+0.0056). Remember that the main effect of very high July temperature is strongly negative (as seen by the large negative spline coefficients in our previous models). This positive interaction coefficient means that as precipitation_Jul increases, it makes the negative effect of temperature less negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "While July precipitation on its own is not a universally strong predictor of maize yield, our model reveals a significant heat-drought interaction. The data shows that adequate rainfall in July acts as a crucial buffer against the damaging effects of extreme heat. The negative impact of a very hot July is significantly less severe in years that also have higher precipitation."

    "The final model reveals a complex, non-linear relationship between July temperature and maize yield. Yields are highest at cooler July temperatures and decrease as heat stress intensifies, reaching a point of maximum stress (lowest predicted yield) around 23-25°C. The model's key finding is a statistically significant interaction with precipitation: while the yield difference between wet and dry years is minimal at cooler temperatures, a clear separation emerges under high heat stress. For example, at a stressful 24°C, a wet July (182 mm) is predicted to yield approximately 1 tonne per hectare more than a dry July (28 mm), demonstrating that adequate rainfall is a key resilience factor that mitigates the most damaging effects of extreme heat. The widening confidence intervals at the temperature extremes responsibly highlight that the model's predictions are most certain within the core 12-24°C range where the historical data is most dense."

    "### **Summary of Progress: Maize Vulnerability Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:** To move beyond our initial baseline OLS models and develop a more statistically robust, interpretable model to quantify the impact of climate stressors on maize yield in Northern Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What We Did & Why (Our Process)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Selected a Better Model:** We moved from a standard linear model (OLS) to a **Gamma Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**.\n",
    "    *   **Why:** A Gamma GLM is statistically more appropriate for crop yield data, which is always positive and often has a skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Refined the Target Variable:** We switched from using the detrended `yield_anomaly` to using the raw `yield_maize` as our outcome. We then added `year` as a predictor in the model.\n",
    "    *   **Why:** This allows us to use the Gamma GLM (which requires positive values) while still controlling for long-term trends like improvements in technology and management practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Systematically Screened for Key Stressors:** Instead of guessing, we ran a loop to test every single climate variable (both seasonal and monthly) in its own simple GLM.\n",
    "    *   **Why:** To objectively rank every stressor based on its statistical power (using the AIC metric) and find the most important drivers of yield *after* accounting for trends and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Built the Best Model Step-by-Step:** We used a \"forward selection\" approach, starting with our best single predictor and carefully adding new variables.\n",
    "    *   **Why:** This avoids the statistical pitfalls of multicollinearity (using redundant variables) and ensures our final model is both powerful and easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What We Found (Our Results for Maize)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Key Stressors Identified:** The screening process confirmed our initial hypothesis: **July temperature** is the single most powerful predictor of maize yield. However, it also uncovered a new, highly significant factor: **May temperature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Main Finding - Complex Interactions:** Our best model(Model 7) revealed two critical interaction effects:\n",
    "    1.  **Spring Conditions Matter:** We found a significant interaction between May and July temperatures. The model shows that a **warm May makes maize more resilient** to the negative impacts of heat stress later in July.\n",
    "    2.  **Rainfall is a Buffer:** We found a significant interaction between July temperature and July precipitation. The model demonstrates that adequate rainfall **mitigates the most severe damage** caused by extreme July heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Non-Linear Damage Confirmed:** The model uses splines to flexibly fit the data, confirming that the negative impact of heat is non-linear—the damage **accelerates as temperatures get hotter**, especially under dry conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps (Our Plan Forward)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our successful workflow for maize now serves as the blueprint for the rest of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **1. Finalize Maize:** We have now established our current best model and a robust analytical process for maize.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **2. Extend to Other Crops:** Our immediate next step is to **apply this exact same process** to the other four crops:\n",
    "    *   Run the stressor screening for **Rice**, then **Soybean**, **Spring Wheat**, and **Winter Wheat**.\n",
    "    *   Build the best multivariate, interactive model for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **3. Synthesize and Compare:** The final goal is to bring all the results together. We will create summary tables and comparative plots to answer the core research question: **How do the specific climate vulnerabilities and resilience factors differ across the major crops of Northern Italy?**"
